TuleTule Starting Files

This is a site that let's the dogs find their soulmates online.

I found this quite interesting to build and while building this site I also managed to rampup my (bootstrap 4.6) skills.

Also, I do think that this site still retains some room for improvement such as:

a) use of CSS and it's arrangements
b) use of Id and classes
c) Responsiveness in certain scenarios
